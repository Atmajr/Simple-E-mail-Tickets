1.) Usage and Code Explanation:
----

emailTicket is designed to be a low-power, low-requirement solution for trouble ticketing in an environment which require minimal oversight and does not have a need for end-user accounts and ticket updates.
When a client visits Index.aspx, they are presented with a form into which they can enter their contact information and the nature of their issue.
On PageLoad, Index.aspx looks for cin= and name= in the querystring and, if it finds them, it will autopopulate these fields.

Each text field on the form has a number of validations associated with it.
-Name:			on submit - validates name is present
-CIN:			on text changed - validates cin is five numeric digits; on submit - validate cin is present
-E-mail:		on text changed - validate e-mail looks valid; on submit - validates either e-mail or phone is present
-Phone:			on text changed - validate phone appeares to be a valid US phone number; on submit - validates either e-mail or phone is present
-ContactPref:	on submit - if a contact prefererence has been selected, verified the related field is populated (i.e. if you choose phone, you must include a phone number)
-Issue:			on submit - validates issue is present

On submit, if all fields validate, a trouble ticket e-mail is generated to the support e-mail that is next up in rotation. 
The rotation is determined by a variable, emailCount, stored in config.txt

Once the e-mail has been generated, the user is redirected to Complete.aspx which presents a small message confirming that the ticket has been generated and,
if autoRespond is turned on and they entered and e-mail address, that a receipt has been sent to them. This page can be edited to include any information you wish.
Currently, it simply presents a link back to the QuickPractice home page.

2.)Using the configuration files
----

emailTicket comes packaged with four plaintext configuration files which can be edited to allow for some control over the app without the need to recompile.
The usage and formatting of these files is explained below.

2a.) config.txt
----

config.txt allows you to set the four global options for the app.

	-emailCount - this is the incremental counter which determines which support engineer will receive the next ticket. DO NOT TOUCH THIS unless you are resetting it to 0.
	-ccToManager - this variable determines whether trouble tickets should be CC: to -ALL- e-mails designated "manager" in emailList.txt. 1 = true, 0 = false. Default value: 1.
	-ccToGeneral - this variable determines whether trouble tickets should be BCC: to -ALL- e-mails designated "general" in emailList.txt. 1 = true, 0 = false. Default value: 0.
	-autoRespond - this variable determines whether auto-response receipts should be e-mailed to the end-user. Whether this is turned on or not, an auto-response will only be generated if the end-use supplies her e-mail address. 1 = true, 0 = false. Default value: 1.

2b.) emailList.txt
----

emailList.txt holds the list of e-mail addresses for the staff behind the software. Any number of e-mail addresses can be added, but for best results maintain at least one address for each category (even if you have ccToManager or ccToGeneral turned off - use a dummy e-mail if need be).
format:
[e-mail type]|[e-mail address]
i.e.
manager|manager@company.com

legal e-mail types:
manager
general
support

2c.) ticketTemplate.txt
----

ticketTemplate.txt maintains the template for the body of the e-mail that is sent to the support employee. 
You can edit this as you like, and variables within it will be automatically replaced at run-time - you may re-use, or not use, variables as you see fit.
The formatting preserves line-breaks, but does not maintain other formatting.

variables:

<datetime> - replaced with the current server date and time in MMM ddd DD HH:MM YYYY format
<name> - name verbatim from textbox
<cin> - cin verbatim from textbox
<email> - email verbatim from textbox
<phone> - phone verbatim from textbox
<contactPref> - based on state of Contact Preference radio button at submit time - "E-mail", "Phone", or "No Preference"
<issue> - issue verbatim from textbox; formatting not preserved

2d.) autoResponse.txt
----

autoResponse.txt maintains the template for the body of the e-mail receipt that is sent to the end-user, 
provided autoRespond is turned on in config.txt and the user has provided an e-mail address.
You can edit this as you like, and variables within it will be automatically replaced at run-time - you may re-use, or not use, variables as you see fit.
The formatting preserves line-breaks, but does not maintain other formatting.

variables:

<datetime> - replaced with the current server date and time in MMM ddd DD HH:MM YYYY format
<contactPref> - based on state of Contact Preference radio button at submit time - "E-mail", "Phone", or "No Preference"
<ticket> - a verbatim copy of the ticket sent to the support engineer, with all variables within

At this time, the other variables included in ticketTemplate.txt are not supported for the autoResponse. Sending ticket details is an all-or-nothing choice.
However, you may opt to send a receipt that simply includes the datetime and/or <contactPref> variables and omits the <ticket> body entirely.
